The importance of each child developing spiritually, physically, intellectually, creatively, socially, behaviorally and emotionally. We aim to be interested in everything about the children in our care, as God is interested. Clear and consistent discipline. We work to maintain fair discipline throughout the Academy with a clear code of conduct that all staff and parents uphold. Clear and consistent discipline. Respect for authority and honor for all. We teach the pupils to respect authority as given by God to parents, teachers and others in the Academy and Church communities. A Biblical world view in all areas of school life.

      des: "Rooted in Christ: We believe that it is our mission to develop students both academically and spiritually so that when they depart from Sol Christian Academy, they are firmly rooted in Christ. We, therefore, provide every student with an education that overflows with Biblical truth in every subject; surrounding them with examples of servant-leaders, and encouraging them to utilize their minds and actions to develop a worldview that is founded in faith. Ready for Tomorrow: We believe that it is our goal to instill in each student the passion to serve the Lord Jesus Christ through their character and leadership. Sol Christian Academy endeavors to prepare students to become Christ-like leaders in their schools, churches, communities, families, and vocations.",
